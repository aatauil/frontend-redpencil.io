      <p>Experience gets you a long way. An eager mind gets you everywhere.
        We expect you to know how to develop software applications. You should know how to solve
        puzzles and how to write code. A diploma shows a lot, so does Open Source work and prior work
        experience. All are appreciated, at least one is required.
        Developing software is a balancing act. We look for someone who:
        - likes coding, likes solving the puzzles without losing sight of the bigger picture;
        - likes to implement use cases and aims for reusable components;
        - likes working with (linked) data;
        - likes to learn new stuff and is not dogmatic about the technologies he/she likes to use.
